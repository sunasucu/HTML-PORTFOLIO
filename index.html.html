        <h3> 🌱 My Journey:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>From Banking to Teaching, and Now into Tech</strong></br>
                Throughout my life, I’ve always been passionate about learning and personal growth. My journey has taken me through very different paths — from working as a customer representative at a bank in Turkey, to teaching English in India and Vietnam, and now stepping into the world of software development.

     <strong>💼 From Corporate Life to the Classroom</strong></br>
     After graduating from university, I began my career as a customer representative in a bank. It taught me how to communicate effectively, solve problems under pressure, and manage responsibilities in a fast-paced environment. But over time, I realized something was missing. Deep down, I had a strong desire to share knowledge, to teach, and to explore new cultures.

    <li>
    <strong>🌏 A New Beginning as an English Teacher</strong></br>
    That inner calling led me to become an English teacher. I taught myself English through my own methods and later earned my TESOL certificate. I started teaching in India and now continue to teach in Vietnam. I've had the chance to work with hundreds of students, each one offering a new perspective. Teaching, for me, became more than just a profession — it was a way to connect, inspire, and build bridges between cultures.
</li>

<li>
    <strong>👩‍💻 Stepping into the World of Code</strong></br>
    While teaching, my interest in technology grew stronger. I’ve always loved solving problems, and coding offered the perfect challenge. I began dedicating my evenings and weekends to learning programming. Today, I’m actively studying software development, data science, and web technologies.
</li>

<li>
     I'm learning languages like Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and regularly practicing on platforms like CodeWars and HackerRank. For me, learning to code isn’t just about changing careers — it's a mindset shift that empowers me to build, create, and think differently
